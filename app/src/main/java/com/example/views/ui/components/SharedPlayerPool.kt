/**
 * Singleton pool of ExoPlayer instances keyed by URL.
 * Allows the same player to be shared between inline feed and fullscreen views
 * so video doesn't stutter or restart on fullscreen toggle.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Feed player calls [acquire] — creates a new player or returns existing one.
 * 2. On fullscreen, feed calls [detach] (keeps player alive but marks it unowned).
 * 3. Fullscreen calls [acquire] — gets the same player, no re-buffer.
 * 4. On exit fullscreen, fullscreen calls [detach], feed calls [acquire] again.
 * 5. When the composable truly disposes (leaves composition), call [release].
